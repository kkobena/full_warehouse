# Tauri Style Loading Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem
After fixing the immediate close issue, the Tauri application was launching but **styles were not loading** - the application appeared unstyled.

## Root Cause

The CSS and SCSS source files contained **absolute paths** for images:
- `/content/images/pharmabg.png` (background image)
- `/content/images/logo.png` (logo in loading animation and navbar)

These absolute paths work fine for web browsers accessing `http://localhost:8080/content/images/logo.png`, but in Tauri, files are loaded from the local filesystem using the `tauri://` protocol. Absolute paths like `/content/images/logo.png` try to load from the root of the filesystem (`C:/content/images/logo.png` on Windows), which doesn't exist.

## Solution

Changed all absolute image paths in CSS/SCSS files to **relative paths** that work correctly after Angular's build process:

### Files Modified:

1. **src/main/webapp/content/scss/global.scss (line 24)**
   ```scss
   /* Before */
   background: url('/content/images/pharmabg.png') no-repeat center center fixed;

   /* After */
   background: url('../../content/images/pharmabg.png') no-repeat center center fixed;
   ```

2. **src/main/webapp/content/css/loading.css (line 145)**
   ```css
   /* Before */
   background-image: url('/content/images/logo.png');

   /* After */
   background-image: url('../images/logo.png');
   ```

3. **src/main/webapp/app/layouts/navbar/navbar.component.scss (line 51)**
   ```scss
   /* Before */
   background: url('/content/images/logo.png') no-repeat center center;

   /* After */
   background: url('../../../content/images/logo.png') no-repeat center center;
   ```

## Why These Paths Work

The relative paths are calculated from the SCSS file location to the image location in the source tree. During Angular's build process:

1. SCSS files are compiled to CSS
2. Image paths are resolved relative to the CSS file location in the output
3. Angular copies images to the output directory and may rename them with content hashes
4. The final paths in the built CSS become relative URLs like `url(pharmabg.68ce3750c26c28f4.png)`

These relative paths work in both:
- **Web mode**: Resolved relative to the current page URL
- **Tauri mode**: Resolved relative to the `index.html` file location

## How to Avoid This Issue in the Future

### ‚úÖ DO: Use Relative Paths in CSS/SCSS
```scss
/* Good - relative path */
background: url('../../content/images/my-image.png');
background: url('../images/my-image.png');
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Use Absolute Paths
```scss
/* Bad - absolute path (breaks in Tauri) */
background: url('/content/images/my-image.png');
```

### ‚úÖ Alternative: Use Angular's Asset Pipeline
Instead of referencing images in CSS, you can use Angular's asset pipeline in your components:
```typescript
// In component TypeScript
backgroundImage = 'content/images/pharmabg.png';
```

```html
<!-- In component template -->
<div [style.background-image]="'url(' + backgroundImage + ')'"></div>
```

## Verification

After the fixes, verify the paths in the built output:

```bash
# Check the built index.html and CSS files
grep -r "pharmabg\|logo.png" target/classes/static/*.{html,css}
```

You should see **relative paths** like:
- `url(pharmabg.68ce3750c26c28f4.png)`
- `url(../images/logo.png)`

NOT absolute paths like:
- ~~`url(/content/images/pharmabg.png)`~~

## Testing

### Test in Development Mode
```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```
The application should load with all styles and images visible.

### Test Production Build
```bash
# Build
npm run tauri:build

# Run the executable
cd src-tauri/target/release
./pharmasmart.exe
```

The application should:
- ‚úÖ Launch without closing
- ‚úÖ Display with full styling
- ‚úÖ Show background images
- ‚úÖ Show logos and icons

## Summary

The style loading issue was caused by **absolute paths in CSS/SCSS files**. Tauri applications run from the local filesystem, not a web server, so absolute paths don't resolve correctly. The fix was to:

1. Convert all absolute image paths (`/content/...`) to relative paths (`../../content/...`)
2. Rebuild the frontend: `npm run webapp:build:tauri`
3. Rebuild Tauri: `cd src-tauri && cargo build --release`

Now the application launches with full styling! üé®‚úÖ
